# 🧾 The First Odin Project: Sign-Up Form

This is my first completed project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form), focused on building a modern, responsive sign-up form using only HTML and CSS.

## 📌 Project Goal

Create a registration page that simulates a real-world service, applying best practices in structure, responsiveness, and visual design. The project includes:

- Input fields for name, email, and password
- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- Custom styling with fonts and spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy and basic accessibility

## 🚀 Getting Started
